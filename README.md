# Pingpong workout
Basic training program for pingpong for when you're tired of coding.
Drills where found searching around on youtube.

## Warming up
All warming up ideas from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D9VWKR-iFc

- [ ] FH Counterattack close to table (diagonally) (4:44)
- [ ] FH Counterattack far from table (diagonally) (5:02)
- [ ] FH Counterattack alternatively close and far from table (diagonally, only one is moving) (5:18)

- [ ] BH Counterattack close to table (diagonally) (5:55)
- [ ] BH Counterattack far from table (diagonally) (6:10)
- [ ] BH Counterattack alternatively close and far from table (diagonally, only one is moving) (6:31)

...when doing these exercises, think about:
- Always move your feet to get into the right position to hit the ball, don't stand still and reach far out for the ball
- Do these at a low enough tempo so you get around 7 balls back and forth
